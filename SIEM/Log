First of all, we need data for the SIEM solution to detect threats. That's why the log collection process is one of the most important parts of the SIEM architecture, because without the log SIEM would be useless.


What is Log and Logging?

In computing, a log file is a file that records either events that occur in an operating system or other software runs, or messages between different users of a communication software. Logging is the act of keeping a log. In the simplest case, messages are written to a single log file. definition: wikipedia.org

It contains a basic log, time, source system and a message. For example, when we look at the content of the "/var/log/auth.log" file on an Ubuntu server, we can see the source, time and message information.


Our goal at this point is to transfer logs from various places (Hosts, Firewall, Server log, Proxy, etc.) to SIEM. Thus, we can process all data and detect threats at a central point. Logs are generally collected in the following 2 ways:


Log Agents
Agentless

Log Agents
In order to implement this method, a log agent software is required. Agents often have parsing, log rotation, buffering, log integrity, encryption, conversion features. In other words, this agent software can take action on the logs it collects before forwarding them to the target. For example, with the agent software, we can divide a log with "username: LetsDefend; account: Administrator" into 2 parts and forward it as:


message1 = "username: LetsDefend"
message2 = "account: Administrator"

Pros of the method

It is a tested, and a working application by the developers
Has many additional features like automatic parsing, encryption, log integrity, etc.


Cons of the method

As the additional features are activated, resource consumption increases. That requires the system's resources such as CPU, RAM to be increased, so the cost increases.


Syslog

It is a very popular network protocol for log transfers. It can work with both UDP and TCP, and can optionally be encrypted with TLS. Some devices that support syslog: Switch, Router, IDS, Firewall, Linux, Mac, Windows devices can become syslog supported with additional software.

You can have your log agents transfer logs with Syslog. For this, you must first parse your logs in syslog format.

Syslog Format:

Timestamp - Source Device - Facility - Severity - Message Number - Message Text

syslog log format


Also, the maximum packet size that can be sent with Syslog UDP is 1024 bytes. For TCP it is 4096 bytes.

3rd Party Agents

Most SIEM products have their own agent software. 3rd party agents have more capabilities than syslog because of the features they support. Some agents:


Splunk: universal forwarder
ArcSight: ArcSight Connectors


These agents are easy to integrate into SIEM and have parsing features.


Popular open source agents:

Agentless
Agentless log sending process is sometimes preferred as there is no installation and update cost. Usually, logs are sent by connecting to the target with SSH or WMI. For this method, the username and password of the log server are required, therefore there is a risk of the password being stolen. Easier to prepare and manage than the agent method. However, it has limited capabilities and credentials are wrapped in the network.


Manual Collection

Sometimes there are logs that you cannot collect with existing agent software. For example, if you cannot read the logs of a cloud-based application with the agent, you may need to write your own script.






Summary
As you can see, there are various ways to collect logs. These are agents and agentless. In cases where the agents on the market are not sufficient, you should write your own scripts.
