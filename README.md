# SOC Home Lab Setup

## 📌 Overview
This project demonstrates the setup of a Security Operations Center (SOC) home lab to monitor and analyze security events in real-time. The lab includes Splunk and the ELK Stack as SIEM tools.

## 🛠 Tools Used
- Splunk
- ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)
- Kali Linux
- Windows 10 VM
- VirtualBox / VMware

## ⚙️ Implementation Steps
1. Installed and configured Splunk and ELK Stack on separate VMs.
2. Created and connected a simulated Windows VM as a log source.
3. Used Kali Linux to launch attacks (e.g., brute force, port scans).
4. Collected logs and monitored them using dashboards.
5. Set up alerts based on event triggers (e.g., failed logins, suspicious IPs).


## ✅ Key Learnings
- Set up and configured SIEM tools from scratch.
- Improved incident detection through log correlation.
- Gained hands-on experience in SOC workflows and tools.
